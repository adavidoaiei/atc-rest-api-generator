# ATC.Net REST API Generator

*Comming soon* 

This repository will in the future take over on code project/parts from the core ATC repository.

Repos that will be moved:
* [Atc.Rest.ApiGenerator](https://github.com/atc-net/atc/tree/master/src/Atc.Rest.ApiGenerator)
* [Atc.Rest.ApiGenerator.CLI](https://github.com/atc-net/atc/tree/master/src/Atc.Rest.ApiGenerator.CLI)

Together with the documentation, test and sample/demo.

This change we not have any effect on the nuget packet / setup, but just seperate the code into it own repository.

This will give the benefit of a better project controle when we talk:
* todo
* feature request
* bugfix
* issues

Furthermore, we will go from Azure DevOps over to pure github actions and workflow to improve the backend build process.
